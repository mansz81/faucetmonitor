## [Faucet Monitor](https://readloud.github.io/faucetmonitor/) - Claim Free Crypto
List of all faucetpay faucets. Sort by different criteria and find the most paying ones.

 Basically it displays all faucets, ad networks, PTC, games and other companies that are using faucetpay microwallet, in a way that allows you to sort and filter them. Why only faucetpay? It is the biggest micropayments wallet and the only one (that I know of) providing needed data by API. If there are other wallets providing this kind of transparency then I can add them in the future too.

 On Faucet Monitor you can see not only how much each company is paying per hour or day, but also when was the last time a payment was sent or how popular it is. This way it is easier to determine which company is more reliable and worth using.

 For your convenience all values are represented in USD, so that it is easier to compare companies that are using different coins (e.g. BTC and LTC). Of course if you are interested only in companies paying by a specific crypto, then you can filter it, e.g. [dogecoin](https://faucetmonitor.com/dogecoin)
